# Landslide Prediction System Documentation

## Overview
The Landslide Prediction System is a machine-learning-based solution designed to predict the likelihood of a landslide based on sensor data. By leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model, the system processes input features such as slope, soil moisture, barometric pressure, rainfall, and vibration to classify conditions as either "Landslide" or "No Landslide."

## Problem Statement
Landslides are catastrophic events triggered by a combination of environmental factors. They pose significant risks to infrastructure, natural resources, and human life. Early detection of landslide conditions is crucial to mitigate potential damage. This system provides an automated, efficient, and reliable mechanism for predicting landslides in real time.

## Features and Data Processing

### Selected Features
The following features were identified as key contributors to landslide prediction:
- **Slope**: Steeper slopes have a higher probability of landslides.

- **Soil Moisture**: Increased moisture levels reduce soil stability.

- **Barometric Pressure**: Changes in atmospheric pressure may correlate with unstable conditions.

- **Rainfall**: Heavy rainfall can saturate the soil, increasing landslide risks.

- **Vibration**: Seismic activity or ground vibrations can destabilize soil structures.

### Preprocessing Steps
- **Feature Normalization**: A `StandardScaler` was used to normalize the feature values, ensuring consistency with the model's training data.

- **Input Validation**: Data inputs are validated to ensure completeness and numerical correctness.

- **Data Format**: Inputs are structured into a tabular format with feature columns matching the training dataset.

## Modeling Approach

### Deep Learning Model
The Landslide Prediction System uses a fully connected neural network for binary classification.

#### Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Accepts five features: `Slope`, `Soil Moisture`, `Barometric Pressure`, `Rainfall`, and `Vibration`.

- **Hidden Layers**:
  - First layer: 128 neurons with ReLU activation.
  - Dropout layer with a rate of 0.2 to prevent overfitting.
  - Second layer: 64 neurons with ReLU activation.
  - Dropout layer with a rate of 0.2.
  - Third layer: 32 neurons with ReLU activation.

- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with sigmoid activation, producing a probability between 0 and 1.

#### Hyperparameters
- **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer.

- **Loss Function**: Binary cross-entropy.

- **Metrics**: Accuracy.

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Dataset
- **Source**: A preprocessed dataset containing labeled instances of landslide-prone and non-landslide conditions.

- **Features**: `Slope`, `Soil Moisture`, `Barometric Pressure`, `Rainfall`, and `Vibration`.

- **Target Variable**: `Landslide` (binary: `1` for Landslide, `0` for No Landslide).

### Data Splitting
- **Training Data**: 80% of the dataset.

- **Testing Data**: 20% of the dataset, with stratified sampling to maintain class balance.

### Training Process
- **Scaler**: A `StandardScaler` was fitted on the training data and applied to both training and testing datasets.

- **Early Stopping**:
  - Monitored validation loss during training.
  - Stopped training if validation loss did not improve for 5 consecutive epochs.
  - Restored the best weights after training.

- **Parameters**:
  - Validation Split: 20% of the training data.
  - Epochs: Maximum of 50 epochs.
  - Batch Size: 64 samples.

### Performance
- The model achieved a test accuracy of approximately **{test_accuracy:.2f}** on the evaluation dataset, indicating good generalization.

### Model Storage
- The trained model was saved as `model/landslide_prediction_model.h5` for deployment.
- The scaler used for feature normalization was saved as `model/scaler.pkl`.

   - Data is validated and normalized using the pre-trained scaler.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Preprocessed data is passed to the neural network model.
   - The model predicts:
     - **Probability**: The likelihood of a landslide.
     - **Binary Classification**: `1` for Landslide, `0` for No Landslide.

4. **Output**:
   - The prediction is presented as a binary result with the associated probability.

## Error Handling
- **Input Validation**:
  - Ensures that all input features are present and numeric.
  - Rejects malformed or incomplete data.

- **Model Errors**:
  - Handles prediction-related errors gracefully using exception handling.

- **Scaler Errors**:
  - Ensures compatibility between the scaler and the input data.
